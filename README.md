This is my final project in a Full Stack Udemy course I did in September 2020. The course taught the basics of Web development, and also some advanced libraries and functionalities using
JavaScript.

In this project I used many techniques and known libraries both for the Front-End part and the Back-End, for example:
Front-End: Bootstrap, FlexBox, Emmet, Jquery, and more.
Back-End: Node.js with Express framework, REST API principles, Ajax and more.

In addition during the course I made 8 more small projects mainly to specialize and gain experience with HTML, CSS and JS.
I hope you'll like it!
